Background Manager
==================

_Background Manager_ is a powerful replacement for the default _[WordPress](http://wordpress.org)_ background manager. 

It allows you to create multiple image sets, from which a random image is selected and displayed as the website background. The images can be uploaded from your local computer, selected from images available in your Media Library, or import them from other plugins and third-party sources.

With an easy to use menu, you can also define how the background image is displayed, such as full-screen (with ratio correction), tiled, fixed or scrolling, and define where the image is positioned. 

You also have the ability to add an overlay to the background images with a choice of pre-defined patterns. And of course it is also possible to add a background color.

Where supported, in full-screen mode the the background image is "eased in" when it is ready to be displayed. No longer will visitors with slower Internet connections have to endure watching a background image load from top down.

You can also limit the background images to certain parts of WordPress, for example only on the front page or a full-page post. And for each individual page or post, you can also override the images and overlay used as the background, which allows you to have pages or posts with a different background theme.

Each individual background image can also be linked to a specific URL, which allows a visitor to click anywhere on the background and be redirected to another page or website.

All this is done without the need to edit the theme or any other files!
